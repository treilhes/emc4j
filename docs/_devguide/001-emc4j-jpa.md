## Overview

Emc4j offers JPA out of the box but:

- Entity scanning is forbiden. @EntityScan has been disabled
- Repository scanning is forbiden @EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages, basePackageClasses) has been disabled

Scanning is disabled because it cost a lot to boot (+- 250 ms per extension). Not realy a big deal for a web application but
an unbearable cost for a local application that need to boot the faster possible

All of your entities and repositories simply must be declared in your extension descriptor Extension#localContextClasses() or Extension#exportedContextClasses() to be loaded
