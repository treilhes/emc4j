  HOW TO HANDLE DIFFERENT BOOTER VERSIONS ?
  - each booter version is independent, so if user install booter A version X.X.X 
    and later install booter A version X.X.X + 1, both can coexist on disk
    
    BUT WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS ?
    
    * booter versions can use different java versions
    > need a new process to launch the app with the right java version
    
  HOW TO HANDLE DIFFERENT CORE VERSIONS ?
  - there is only one core version on user home .emc4j but each booter can install its own core version
    so if booter A install core version C version X.X.X and later booter B install core version C version X.X.X + 1
    both core versions will coexist on user home .emc4j
    
    BUT WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS ?
    
    * core versions can use different javafx versions
    > need a new process to launch the app with the right javafx version ?
